          My name is Kevin Medina Velazquez, and I am a burgeoning software developer with roots deeply embedded in a first-generation Mexican-American heritage. This background has imbued me with a profound appreciation for the principles that hard work fosters superior outcomes and the importance of extending equal respect to all individuals.

          As a junior developer, I am on a continual journey of learning and personal growth, engaging with each project with a fresh perspective and an eager mind. My tenure in the technology domain began with a significant milestoneâ€”developing a website for Baja Mobile Mechanic. This project not only marked my initial foray into the tech industry but also served as a practical application of the skills I honed during an intensive 3-month software engineering program at General Assembly. Each step of this journey has been a testament to my commitment to excellence and an enduring quest for knowledge.
